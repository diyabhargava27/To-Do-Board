# Setup Instructions # ‚öôÔ∏è

## 1. Backend
cd backend
npm install
touch .env

 Run the backend as -
     npm start
     
## 2. Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

üéØ Smart Assign Logic
When "Smart Assign" is clicked , the backend finds the user with the fewest non-completed tasks and assigns the task to them.

# Conflict Resolution System #
# Problem Statement #
Handles simultaneous edits to the same task by multiple users.

# Implemented Logic #
# 1. Version Trackin
- Each task has version field(Integer)
- Incremented on every update

# 2. Conflict Detection
If two or more users try to update the same task simultaneously:
- the backend checks for conflicts using updatedAt timestamps.
- if conflict detected , both versions are returned
- the frontend shows popup to Merge or Overwrite

# Usage Guide #
1. Register / Login
2. Create tasks using the (+) button
3. Use drag-drop to move task across columns.
4. Assign users manually or click smart assign
5. Watch real-time updates as teammates work!
6. View activity logs at bottom of the dashboard
